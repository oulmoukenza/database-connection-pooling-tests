# GitHub Repository Setup

## ðŸš€ Ready to Push to GitHub!

Your complete connection pooling performance test suite is ready. Here's how to create the GitHub repository:

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `database-connection-pooling-tests`
3. Description: `Performance benchmarks demonstrating dramatic improvements with database connection pooling`
4. Make it **Public** (to share with the community)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Your Code
```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/database-connection-pooling-tests.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. What's Included
